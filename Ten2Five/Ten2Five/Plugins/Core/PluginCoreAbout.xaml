This is a small tool designed to assist with the <Run FontStyle="Italic">Ten-Two-Five</Run> productivity hack, whereby you work solidly for 10 minutes, stop for two minutes (ensuring that you actually DO stop), and repeat five times for a total of one hour.  Tasks should be broken down in to tiny pieces, that can be worked on (ideally completed) in 10 minute slots - if you finish one move straight on to the next one.

You can pause the clock by clicking on it.

The tool itself also includes "Plugins", i.e. things to do during down periods (possibly poorly named "Play" times).
