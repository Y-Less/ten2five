This is a simple program that assists with the "Ten-Two-Five" procrastination hack, originally documented here:

I first encountered it via a link to this version (whose design I shamelessly stole (with permission after the fact)):

http://chads.website/tentwofive/

The technique seemed to work quite well for me, but that site was missing a few features that I wanted (most notably, persistence of tasks), so I wrote my own.  The fact that I got this tool off the ground to a reasonably usable state is actually a testament to the technique in itself.

I also used it as a learning excercise to improve my C#, so the code is a bit all-over the place.  The tool itself will only open one instance, and minimises to the taskbar (I intend to make the icon animated to match the clock).  To pause the time (and optionally any music you have playing), click on the current clock.  During down time, you can engage in optional other activities - only one exists at the moment and that is for learning words, which I wrote for myself since I'm learning Russia and suck at vocabulary.
